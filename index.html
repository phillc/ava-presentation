            - I thought I was being funny
              - What if I could beat all these people with a “slow” language.
                - I don’t believe node/server side JavaScript had much popularity at the time.
              - At one point I had the best JavaScript bot
            - I was set to go on a huge adventure

            Note:
            Started My exploration into javascript outside a browser. If it wasn't for this competition, I probably would have never given node a thought.

            ## Hearts

            - Playable by humans
              - Easy to pick up
              - Very social game
            - Skill based
              - Good feeling of level of control
              - A decent curve until proficiency
            - Winnable
              - Random enough
              - Even a human playing against three perfect AI could potentially win
            - 4 player FFA game
              - 1v1 games directly weigh you vs your opponent
                - If they crush you, well you lose undoubtedly. Not fun.
              - 2v2 games weight you vs your opponents vs how you interact with a partner
                - So not only do you have to figure out what your opponents are doing, you have to figure out what your potentially dumb teammate is doing
              - FFA games weigh you vs your opponents and how they react to each other
                - A person who crushes everyone can start to get targeted... or at the very least I can squeak in a second place finish.
            - Card game
              - Game tree isn't too large
              - Simple rules

            - Hearts
            - Agents
            - Design Goals:
              - Targeted at small groups of people (companies, clubs, friends)
                - Allow many languages (Apache Thrift)
                  - As3, C Glib, C++, CSharp, D, Delphi, Erlang, Go, Haskell, Java, Java Me, Javascript, Node.js, Objective-c, OCaml, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Smalltalk
                - Low barrier to entry (simple installation and starting)
                - Privately deployable
                - Human playable – web UI
                - Low infrastructure costs

            Note:
            - In the AI contest, there was the private server
            - (Go over the current state of it)
            - I intend to host this on my raspberry pi

            - More games

            - Lower the barrier to entry
            - Provide better sample agents
            - Work through the quirks of supporting so many languages that may have different paradigms
            - Facilitate small groups
              - Live server showing replays of a moon shooting

            - Haven't quite figured out starter packages

              - Refine interactions
              - If an invalid move occurs, throw exception or pass a message?
              - Reduce barrier to entry
              - Restructure thrift data types to not be so cryptic or overly verbose

            Note:
            - Forever project

            ## My personal goals

            1. Write a monad, or at least grok them
              - Once again, if you know haskell...
            2. Achieve a high level of comfort with highly asynchronous events
            3. Learn many different languages
              - I have to maintain all the sample agents
              - Next competition I will make another attempt at clojure
            4.  Have an achievable side project
            5.  Dominate all opposition

            Note:
            - My goals have self learning ingrained
            - Async and evented patterns already becoming quite large... testing style is different
            - I am upset at the fact that my last clojure attempts have been thwarted by maven.
            - Learned go, then wrote an agent in it, and it wasn't completely destroyed.

            ## Technical details - Server

            - node.js
              - npm (ease of package installation and updating)
              - Accessibility (emergence of node, brew)
              - Async, evented
              - Personal ability
              - Not one of the crazy languages I wanted to learn (if I had any hope of ever receiving contributions)

            Note:
            I was going to write it in erlang or go

            ## Technical details - Apache Thrift

            - Facebook
            - 2007
            - Open sourced to ASF
            - Create a definition file, which then generates interfaces in many languages, and provides a TCP client for each of the languages
            - Chosen for language reach, the packaged clients, and declared interface; not for data efficiency
            - As3, C Glib, C++, CSharp, D, Delphi, Erlang, Go, Haskell, Java, Java Me, Javascript, Node.js, Objective-c, OCaml, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Smalltalk
            - I haven’t written a starter/sample agent in each of these, but the barrier to entry should be low

            Note:
            - Thrift more procedural... or rather closer to the paradigm of a language, like node is callbacks.
            - Thrift is for reach, could do long polling, jsonrpc or something...
            - But how much is gained is worth it
